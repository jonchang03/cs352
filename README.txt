CS352 - Programming Project Part 1


Dear Professor Martin:

Our group tried our very best to follow both your slides slides and the Kukrose book's description to implement the GBN protocol. To do so, we wrote a header file called "socklib352.h," and the corresponding "sock352lib.c" which contained our library of functions, some added internal functions, and also the structures we defined such as connection and fragment. We believe that our functions are correct for the most part, but we were not able to figure out the timer and receiver threads completely because of our lack of experience with pthreads. (One of us is currently taking Systems Programming, and the other has not taken CS214.) 

As you can tell by just the sheer length of our code, our group put a lot of effort into trying to figure out this assignment. We essentially spent the entire past week coding, and were in constant communication with the TA's, trying to do whatever was necessary to get our program to work. We hope that even though our program does not ultimately perform as planned (even with the considerate project extensions), you will consider the grading breakdown and award us some more points for the work we have actually completed.

Regards,
Shihang Zhang and Jonathan Chang
